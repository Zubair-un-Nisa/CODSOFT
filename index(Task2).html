Passenger can get all the information like confirmation of ticket of if it is in waiting by the PNR number. It is also possible to cancel the ticket online. This paper generates codes as well as results for the passenger who are booking ticket of train online. Through this system, a practical approach has been taken under study to understand how online reservation system works. This system will include all the necessary fields which are required during online reservation system. This system will be easy to use and can be used by any person.

        <h3> Hotel Management System</h3><br>
         <p>Computer network has become the most significant issue in our day-to-day life. Networking 
            companies depend on the proper functioning and analysis of their networks for Front Office 
            Department Housekeeping Department, Food and Beverage Service Department. Food 
            Production or Kitchen Department, Reception area etc. Mainly interfacing with the network is 
            induced by one of the other user/users to share some data with them. Therefore, this paper is 
            about communication among users present at remote sites, sharing this same network DHCP. 
            DHCP stands for the Hotel Network Scenario. Therefore, in this work the network is designed 
            using Cisco Packet Tracer. The paper describes how the tool can be used to develop a 
            simulation model of the Hotel of Bahawalnagar. The study provides into various 
            concepts such as topology design, IP address configuration and how to send information in the 
            form of packets in a single network and the use of virtual Local Area Network (VLANs) to 
            separate the traffic generated by a different department.</p>
